title: some cool things from 2020
---
2020 wasn't an easy year for anyone, and neither was it short of challenges. This was the year when I learnt the meaning of grief, and how to navigate through pain.
And while I don't think I'm *there* yet, I feel certain things definitely helped ease the struggle, and I'd like to log these, for future me.

# Music
This year was definitely the year of phonk and reverbed songs for me. I discovered many new artists on SoundCloud including, 
- A L E X
- deishin
- JOSEPH LETRANGER
- Inteus

# Books
While the lockdown brought in tons of idle time, I didn't really expand my reading list, which is probably a goal for 2021. 
- Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Sáenz [3/5]
- Atomic Habits by James Clear [5/5]
- Road to Reality by Roger Penrose [unfinished, but so far 4/5]
- Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl [4/5]
- Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë [4/5]

# Games
### Doom (1993)
A classic favorite of mine, and while the graphics seem too janky for 2020, the memories associated with this game were definitely worth it.
### Genshin Impact
Great game, and good graphics, however gets boring a bit too quickly. 
### Sky: Children of the Light
A sequel to Journey, this game helped calm the nerves down, and helped me escape the reality a little bit. Good graphics, great soundtrack.

# Movies and TV
- My Brother Jordan [4/5]
- Queen's Gambit [5/5]
- Beautiful Boy [2/5]
- Mr Robot [5/5]

# Other things that were cool in 2020
### ShaktiCTF
We finished 8th on the leaderboard, and albeit it was an easy CTF, it felt rewarding. 
### Journalling 
I took up this habit more seriously this year, and I'm so glad I did. Journalling made it easier for me to sort through difficult emotions, and definitely helped in 
some serious introspection.


While this might've been the most difficult year for me yet, I'm really grateful for all these things that helped me cope and face everyday with a bit more ease.
I learnt a lot about myself through pain, and learnt to take better care of my mental health as well. And while I hope 2021 goes a bit easy on everyone, I feel
regardless the adversity, I shall learn to be okay.
