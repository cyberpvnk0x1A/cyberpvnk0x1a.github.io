# Hello World!
Well this is finally happening I guess, my own website and a life-log.
This isn't supposed to be a personal diary by any sorts, but in fact things I've learnt and would like to reflect later on in my life.
Which obviously implies that it's not regularly updated either.
2021 is in 2 days, which also doesn't feel real, but I hope it's a bit better than 2020, for everyone. 
Anyway, I shall sign off now,
